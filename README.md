# App-Development
Overview:
SafeM8 is an innovative, home-based robotic assistant designed to seamlessly integrate real-time security monitoring with interactive STEM learning for children. Developed as an affordable and modular solution, SafeM8 addresses the growing need for multifunctional smart home devices by combining AI-powered surveillance, emergency alerts, and a child-friendly coding platform—all in one compact robot.

Key Features:
1. Intelligent Home Security
AI-Driven Surveillance: Equipped with Pixy 2.1 camera and motion/temperature sensors to detect anomalies (e.g., intruders, fire risks) and send real-time alerts via the companion app.

Autonomous Patrolling: Navigates autonomously or manually via app control, with auto-docking for uninterrupted operation.

Emergency Alerts: Notifies users of unusual activity (e.g., prolonged inactivity, temperature spikes) through Firebase-linked mobile notifications.

2. Interactive STEM Learning
QR-Code Programming: Children learn basic coding by scanning QR codes to program the robot’s movements and actions, fostering early tech literacy.

Modular Upgrades: Supports future add-ons (e.g., advanced sensors, coding modules) under the RMSOO framework for scalability.

3. Smart Home Integration
Compatible with Alexa and Google Home for voice-controlled operation.

Open-source APIs enable seamless connectivity with existing IoT ecosystems.

4. User-Centric Design
Affordable & Sustainable: Cost-effective components (e.g., STM32 microcontroller, ESP32 WiFi) balance performance and budget.

Privacy-First: Local data processing minimizes cloud dependency, addressing IoT security concerns.

Technical Highlights
Hardware: STM32F4 microcontroller, Pixy 2.1 AI camera, LiPo battery with smart charging.

Software: Custom Android app (Firebase backend) for remote control and alerts.

Firmware: Autonomous navigation algorithms and sensor fusion (motion, temperature, gas).

Why SafeM8?
Dual Utility: Replaces standalone security cameras and educational robots, reducing cost and clutter.

Child Engagement: Makes STEM learning accessible through hands-on interaction.

Future-Ready: Modular design allows upgrades as technology advances.
